I have developed the following [snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) workflows during the course of my doctoral degree.

### [RNA-Seq-Pop](https://github.com/sanjaynagi/rna-seq-pop)

A Snakemake pipeline for Illumina RNA-sequencing experiments, including variant calling and more - relating to population genetics and insecticide resistance

### [impute-Ag](https://github.com/sanjaynagi/impute-Ag)

An imputation and phasing workflow for low coverage sequencing data in Anopheles gambiae (still under construction).
