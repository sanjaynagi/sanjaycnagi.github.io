Hello! I'm a PhD student at the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/), in the Vector Informatics and Genomics group.

To date, my work has focused on major mosquito vectors of disease. In particular, the rapid evolution and spread of resistance in the major malaria vector, *Anopheles gambiae*, is a major focus. I am also interested in the underlying genetic mechanisms behind the regulation of resistance-associated genes, such as the involvement of non-coding RNAs.

### My PhD 

I was recently awarded an MRC CASE studentship, at the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Professor Martin J Donnelly](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-martin-james-donnelly). My PhD aims to determine the role of genomic surveillance of a vector population during an intervention, in the context of a large-scale next generation bed-net trial. As part of the project, we will discover genomic variants under selection, and apply CRISPR-Cas9 based transgenesis to investigate the role of these in conferring resistance to insecticides. I have also developed a snakemake RNA-Sequencing workflow for analyses into insecticide resistance, investigated a large selective sweep in West African populations of *Anopheles gambiae s.s.*, and in the process of developing an Illumina amplicon sequencing panel. 

During my three MRes rotations, I applied machine learning algorithms to the [Anopheles 1000 genomes](http://www.malariagen.net/ag1000g) data, built gene regulatory networks in the context of insecticide resistance, and was fortunate enough to conduct fieldwork on the Illovo sugar estate, Chikwawa, Malawi.

Here is me hard at work - running through an irrigation system, sugar cane in hand...
