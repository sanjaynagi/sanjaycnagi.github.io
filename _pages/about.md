My work is focused on major mosquito vectors of disease. I am interested in population genomics, and in particular, the rapid evolution and spread of resistance in the major malaria vector, *Anopheles gambiae*, is a major focus. I am also interested in investigating the underlying genetic mechanisms behind the regulation of resistance-associated genes, such as the involvement of non-coding RNAs.

I was recently awarded an MRC CASE studentship, at the [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/). The studentship is a 4 year programme - a 1 year [MRes](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/postgraduate-courses/global-health-translational-and-quantitative-skills-mres/) followed by a 3 year PhD. 

My PhD aims to determine the role of genomic surveillance of a vector population during an intervention, in the context of a large-scale next generation bed-net trial. As part of the project, we will discover genomic variants under selection, and apply CRISPR-Cas based transgenesis to investigate the role of these in conferring resistance to insecticides.

During my three MRes rotations, I applied machine learning algorithms to the [Anopheles 1000 genomes](http://www.malariagen.net/ag1000g) data, built gene regulatory networks in the context of insecticide resistance, and was fortunate enough to conduct fieldwork on the Illovo sugar estate, Chikwawa, Malawi.
